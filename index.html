    <h4>Methodology</h4>

    <p>
      This analysis evaluates public asset exposure to flooding under current and
      future conditions using floodplain datasets developed by Rutgers University
      and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP).
    </p>

    <p>
      The <strong>2025 flood scenario</strong> represents the 1% annual chance
      (100-year) floodplain derived from Rutgers’ modified statewide FEMA Flood
      Hazard Area layer, integrating effective and preliminary FEMA Flood Insurance
      Rate Maps and modeled water-surface elevations under current conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <strong>2050 flood scenario</strong> represents the 1% annual chance (100-year)
      floodplain plus three feet of additional flood
      elevation, developed by Rutgers in consultation with NJDEP to align
      with New Jersey’s Inland Flood Protection Rule.
    </p>

    <p>
      Public asset locations were buffered by <strong>100 feet</strong> to account
      for building footprints, access constraints, and localized service disruption
      beyond a single point location. Assets were classified as exposed if their
      buffered area intersected either floodplain.
    </p>

    <p class="popup-note">
      Flood scenarios represent water-level–based flooding only and do not include
      rainfall-driven runoff, stormwater ponding, or sewer system impacts.
